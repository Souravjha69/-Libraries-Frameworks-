# -Libraries-Frameworks-
Libraries and frameworks streamline software development. Libraries like React, NumPy, and jQuery offer reusable code, while frameworks such as Angular, Django, and Ruby on Rails provide structured approaches and built-in tools. These resources enhance efficiency, consistency, and allow developers to focus on writing unique, high-quality code.
